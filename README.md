# Pig: A Dice Game

As a Java student at Tech Elevator (a coding bootcamp in Cleveland, OH), this was my first side project, 
where I aimed to apply concepts we had learned in class to a different context. I learned about class 
modeling - the original version started with all of the responsibility of the "Player" class residing in
the "Game" class, but I have reorganized it in what seems to be a much better way. I also learned the basics of encapsulation through this project.

My next step for the project is to add a computer player(s) functionality. Stay tuned!
